 The Last Lecture was really inspiring. I think that his intro spoke out the most to me, when he said that he was given a limited time to live, but he was doing just fine I thought that was crazy. If something like that happened to me, I don't know if I would be able to find the strength to get out of bed. That aside, hearing him talk about his dreams and how he achieved them were really nice. I love hearing people talk about their dreams cause I always want to see them completed. Not to mention that If I surround myself with people who dream and want to complete them, I hope they can inspire me to continue my own dreams. When he talks about mentors Inspirating him, I like to think back to a teacher I had in high school. He was only there for my last 2 years, but I felt a more personal connection to him than I did from any other teachers. He was really cool and inspired me to work harder. His class was the first History class that I got an A in. Another point that stuck out to me is how much Randy Pausch talks about fun. It seems that is what most people should be looking for when going for a dream. The dream is one thing, but the fun you have along the way could be just as rewarding.
