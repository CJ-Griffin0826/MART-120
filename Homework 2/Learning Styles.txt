After Taking the Learning types test, I was told I am a Visual Learner by 50%, Tactile by 40% and Auditory by 10%. I can see this being vary true. I know for sure I am not an Auditorial learner because I zone out very easily. If i have something like a visual to zone out on, I think it helps me out a lot. I very much so believe that learning styles affect our learning and that everyone learns differently. If everything in school was just someone talking to my face and then sending me out with homework, I would have failed out long ago.
