        <span id="redColor">Here is a short summary of my favorite story One Piece</span>
    
        <br />
    
        <span id="redColor">One piece revolves around Luffy, a boy who sets out to become the King of Pirates. However, before he can reach his goal, he would have to assemble a very good pirate crew and then navigate his way to Raftel.</span>
    
        <br />
    
        <span id="redColor">In order to get to Raftel, Luffy and his crew would need to find the map to Raftel; the problem though is that the map can only be gotten from combining Poneglyphs (ancient texts left by an ancient civilization).</span>
    
        <br />
    
        <span id="redColor">Also, the World Government (a political organization made up of the majority of the world) rules pirates as threats to the world, making them kind of illegal. The World Government uses the Marines by placing bounties on pirates that prove themselves to be notorious. This makes it very difficult for pirates to sail around freely. Thus, Luffy must constantly fend off the Marines that try to capture him and his friends while facing the difficulties of pirate rivalry.</span>
    
        <br />
    
        <span id="redColor">And finally, the best part: Devil fruits. These mystical fruits give whoever eats them special abilities, which vary from (1) controlling elemental forces of nature (Logia types) to (2) becoming an ancient or mythical creature (Mythical zoan type) to (3) having abilities other than the first and second (Paramecia type). However, whoever eats such fruits loses the ability to swim.</span>
